# Dynamic Todo App with Sections  

This project is a **React-based Todo App** where you can:  

- Create multiple **sections** (like Food, Sports, Work, etc.).  
- Each section has its own **separate Todo list**.  
- Add and remove todos inside each section.  
- New sections start with a blank Todo list.  
- Data is stored in **localStorage** so todos donâ€™t disappear after page refresh.  

## Features Implemented
- Dynamic sidebar with sections.  
- Separate Todo list for each section.  
- Persistent data storage using localStorage.  
- Clean and responsive UI.
